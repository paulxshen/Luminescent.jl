# Inverse Design
## Overview
Workflow same as simulation. Only difference is passing additional args to `make_prob` : `designs`, `targets`, `optimizer`. `solve` then runs optimization loop instead of single simulation. Each iteration has forward and backward pass. Forward pass is a simulation that has to save all intermediate fields to compute gradients in backward pass. Each iteration is >5x slower than single simulation. >40 iterations typically needed to converge. Altogether >200x slower than single simulation.
