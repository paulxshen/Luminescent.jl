# Installation
Please fill out [new user form](https://forms.gle/fP9wAkdJinT8t66w8) to obtain install scripts for unrestricted simulation. Doesn't include inverse design.

## Option 1: Luminescent Community Cluster (free and public)
Run on our latest Nvidia Blackwell GPUs for free! Just [register](https://forms.gle/fP9wAkdJinT8t66w8) and install our python frontend via `pip install luminescent`. Then see our simulation tutorials. All your jobs on the community cluster are publicly visible. If you want a private and secured environment, please upgrade to an enterprise cluster.

## Option 2: Luminescent Enterprise Cluster (private and secure)
Similar to community cluster but private and secured for your organization. Comes with premium support and consulting. Pricing is a fixed annual fee plus $3 per GPU hour (similar to raw rates on GCP or AWS). Sign up via info@luminescentai.com

## Option 3: Local Installation
Customers of Enterprise Cluster are also entitled to local installation binaries upon request.
