# Photonic PDK
Lumi Photonic PDK (process design kit) is a library of AI inverse designed photonic components for PIC (photonic integrated circuit). Unlike a traditional PDK, each component here is more akin to a reference design that shows what's possible. In most cases, they should be re-optimized for your specific needs and process node.
